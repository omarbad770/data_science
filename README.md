1-Project 1 : Diabetes Prediction using SVM
**Project Description:**
This project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict diabetes based on health features. After preprocessing the 'diabetes.csv' dataset, the SVM model is trained and evaluated for accuracy. The goal is to provide a reliable tool for early diabetes detection, showcasing the application of machine learning in healthcare.
